# grafana-image-renderer

A backend service for Grafana.
It provides panel and dashboard rendering with a headless browser (Chromium).
You can get your favourite dashboards as PDFs, PNGs, or with Grafana Enterprise, CSVs and even over emails with Grafana Reports.

## Installation

You can find installation details in the [docs](/docs/sources/_index.md).

<!-- FIXME: Use the grafana.com docs when it's published -->

## Compile

To compile the Go service, run:

```shell
$ go build -buildvcs -o grafana-image-renderer .
```

To compile the Docker image, run:

```shell
$ docker build .
```

The following tools are also useful for engineers:

```shell
$ go tool goimports # our code formatter of choice
$ golangci-lint run # our linter of choice
$ IMAGE=tag-here go test ./tests/acceptance/... -count=1 # run acceptance tests
```

## Release

When you are ready to make a release, tag it in Git (`git tag vX.Y.Z`; remember the `v` prefix), then push it.
GitHub Actions deals with the build and deployment.
