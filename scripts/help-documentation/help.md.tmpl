# Image rendering flags

This section aims to list the entire set of flags that can be used to configure the image rendering service.

## Configuration format

To configure the service, any of the following methods can be used:

- Set CLI flags. These are passed in on the command line, and take complete precedence over all other methods.
  For example, `--server.addr=":8081"` sets the HTTP address to listen on all interfaces on port `8081`.
- Set environment variables. These are set in the environment.
  If environment variables are supported for a flag, they are listed in the help command.
- Write a JSON or YAML configuration file. These must be named `config.json`, `config.yaml`, or `config.yml`.
  There should only be one file; precedence is undefined if multiple files are present.
  Dot-separated keys are nested keys. For example, the flag `a.b` becomes `{"a": {"b": "VALUE"}}` in the file.
  The configuration keys are always mentioned in the help command alongside the flag.

For example, a complete configuration file might look like this in YAML:

```yaml
server:
  addr: ":8081" # server.addr
  auth-token: # server.auth-token
    - "a"
    - "b"
```

## List of flags
