# ADR-0002: Logs

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a way to communicate logs with our observability platform.

## Considered Options

* Do nothing: don't log; just be a silent black box.
* Log to stdout: let some other application deal with collecting the logs for us.
* Push to OTLP: support standard OpenTelemetry collectors.

## Decision Outcome

We're going for logging to stdout:

* We want to know what's going on: this rules out not logging anything.
* We don't want to take on scope that is not necessary.
* The ecosystem for scraping logs from platforms like Docker, systemd journalling, and Kubernetes are all very mature, so we'd be reinventing the wheel by pushing ourselves.
* If we choose pushing, we would not support the likes of systemd journalling or setups that don't use centralised logging solutions.
