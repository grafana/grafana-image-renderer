# ADR-0000: Using ADRs

## Context and Problem Statement

We have historically lost a lot of context on _why_ the service was built in the way it was.
This has time and time again led to breaking things, re-learning, re-discovering, and questioning the decisions with no track record to answer our questions.

In the future, we want to avoid this as much as possible, as this service _will_ go long treks of time where minimal input is done to it, and it may even go owner-less or with extremely minimal interaction.

## Considered Options

* Do nothing: just let the information die in the ether.
* Use [MADR](https://github.com/adr/madr)s to document our architectural decisions.
* Write form-free ADRs.

## Decision Outcome

We're going for MADRs:

* They are written in Markdown, i.e. natively rendered in most modern GUI editors, and in the GitHub UI.
  When they are not rendered, they are still easily readable.
* They are lean, yet require to write down the most critical context. This is handy for the one kind of engineer that exists: lazy ones.
* They demand assumptions we written down, so the future generations can understand how we came to a specific conclusion.
